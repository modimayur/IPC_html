                            <p>Ansel Adams once said: “You don’t take a photograph, you make it.” PDN Faces recognizes
                                the powerful portraits that photographers make, including assignment and personal work,
                                plus celebrity, animal and kids portraiture.</p>
                                <p>Professional and amateur photographers are judged separately, and are eligible for prizes
                                    that include a $500 B&H gift card, one-page features in PDN. All winners will be
                                celebrated in the January 2020 issue of PDN and on pdnonline.com, shared with our
                                network of more than half a million readers and followers. 5,000 additional copies of
                                PDN will be sent directly to photo-industry creatives looking to hire new and
                                established talent.</p>

                        <p>Digital images should have a long dimension of at least 2,000 pixels and be saved at 300 dpi (around 7" or larger) jpeg. We recommend the uncompressed file size not be larger than 4 megabytes to ensure a fast upload experience. We can accept images that are up to 50 megabytes (uncompressed) if you do not have the ability to downsize the images (uncompressed is the size you see in Photoshop's "Image Size" display which represents the count of pixels in the image: It is not the file size on your computer's hard drive viewable on your desktop). Images may be color profiled in sRGB, Adobe-1998, or not color-managed.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0"><b>HOW ARE THE ENTRIES JUDGED ?</b></p>
                        <p>Judging is subjective; however, we have a few simple guidelines for putting together your entry.</p>
                        <p>If you are entering a single image, make sure it's strong on its own. You may choose to also enter it as part of a series, but as a single, it should relay the story, moment or concept you want to convey.</p>
                        <p>If you are entering a series, make your series cohesive. If it is not from the same photographic series or project, a visual relation that ties the imagery together is key. Judges will be making decisions based upon the strength of the series as a whole. Make a careful edit of your images and order them the way you want them to be viewed.</p>
                        <p>Trust your instincts, but also ask the advice of those you trust. Sometimes you need another opinion to improve your edit. Ask someone with a good eye, be it another artist, your rep or a creative who has experience in the field.</p>
